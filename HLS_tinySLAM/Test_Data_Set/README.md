This code represents the deployment of the tinySLAM algorithm using the HLS methods on the PYNQ-Z2 FPGA using Jupyter Notebooks.

The HLS tinySLAM code uses the same methods for both the Test-Data and the Live Sensor Data.

This system uses the same test dataset as the tinySLAM methods in C/C++ and regular Python
