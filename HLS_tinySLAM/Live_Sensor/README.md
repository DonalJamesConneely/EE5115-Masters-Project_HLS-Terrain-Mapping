This code represents the Live Sensor Version of the tinySLAM algorithm using the HLS methods and the RPLiDAR.

The HLS tinySLAM code uses the same methods for both the Test-Data and the Live Sensor Data.

The Development of the RPLiDAR code for deployment on Jupter Notebooks can be seen in this repository at:
