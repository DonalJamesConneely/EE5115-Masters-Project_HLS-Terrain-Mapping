This is the C/C++ implementation of the tinySLAM algorithm using a Live Sensor.

The system is designed around the use of a SLAMTec RPLiDAR A1M8 using the SDK found at:
http://www.slamtec.com/en/support#rplidar-a-series

The code found in this repository is a direct modification of the original RPLiDAR SDK using tinySLAM code. Thus some elements of the RPLiDAR library not used in the project remain.

To run the code simply go to:
\sdk\workspaces\vc10\sdk_and_demo.sln

Open the Visual studio project sdk_and_demo.sln and run the Test.cpp
